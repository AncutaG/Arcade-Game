# Just P4 Arcade-Game
## A funny, simple, tricky game, which is part from the Udacity FEND Nanodegree scholarship 

# Get Started
The game will be launched directly.Maybe later on for future improvement it could be added also the start window with some character selection.But for now, this was not the main focus.

# How to play and why
All you need to know is that the arrow keys will help you to move the "Hero-girl".
- Just pay attention to your enemies: the bugs and... the stones that practically will block the girl in some parts... you'll need to figure it out how to move your hero.
- When the bug will hit the girl this will bring her to the intial position always.
- The final purpose is to go where the girl's heart is and help her to take her heart back.
Good luck, it's not that harsh! 
### some small detail: 
There will a bug that is on purpose there to trick a bit the hero and create some small illusion.
It's a bug which is not that close to the girl :) and won't "reset" her  to the initial position.

# To develop the game
- There were used most of the existent pieces of code, the objects are found in app.js  file with their properties and methods.
- The other two files engine.js and resources.js manage the game loop.
- Not very much to say about styling and html files, because the main focus was to learn more on JS object orientated programming.

# Running the code game:

The game could be easily run by opening the index.html file into de console, the rest of the JS scripts are linked within the html file.
Also one can access the preview  [right here :)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AncutaG/Arcade-Game/blob/master/index.html). 

Have fun !

## Notes and referrences:
There is some intution that helped me a lot to remain with a better understanding, structure, beyond my own creativity and how I thought the logic of some elements and [this helped me a lot :) ](https://matthewcranford.com/?s=Arcade).
